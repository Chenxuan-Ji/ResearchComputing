    "# Automatic documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This course itself is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) using a [theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme) provided by [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com/?ref=readthedocs.org). \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is automatic documentation?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is documentation generated automatically out of **docstrings** in your package code, as well as other metadata and documentation in your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Docstrings are comments typically placed under your function/class definitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance in the `base_company.py` file (see [here](https://github.com/borisbolliet/company_package/blob/main/company/base_company.py)): \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def summarize_activity(self, *args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Summarizes company activities and additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Parameters:\n",
    "        - *args: A list of activities related to the company.\n",
    "        - **kwargs: Additional information, like location or date.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Every function/class in your package should have a docstring, and some functions can have more details, for instance\n",
    "including example on how to use the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance in the `medical.py` file (see [here](https://github.com/borisbolliet/company_package/blob/main/company/medical/medical.py)): \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def drug_approval_summary(self, dataset_path=None):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Prints a summary of drug approval attempts for the company's drugs.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Parameters:\n",
    "        - dataset_path (str): Path to the dataset with drug approval data.\n",
    "          If not provided, uses the default package data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Example:\n",
    "            >>> medical_company = MedicalCompany(\"Pfizer\", \"Pharmaceuticals\", drug_manufacturer=True)\n",
    "            >>> medical_company.drug_approval_summary()\n",
    "            \n",
    "            Drug Approval Summary for Pfizer:\n",
    "             - Drug A: 2 failed attempt(s) before approval\n",
    "             - Drug B: 0 failed attempt(s) before approval\n",
    "             - Drug C: 1 failed attempt(s) before approval\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The automatic documentation is then generated from these docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sphinx\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sphinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_(documentation_generator)) is a tool primarily used to create comprehensive and structured documentation for Python projects. It takes reStructuredText (reST) or Markdown files and generates clean, organized documentation in HTML, PDF, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very simple to set-up. You can automatically create a template version by running `sphinx-quickstart` or do so manually by adding a `docs` folder in the root folder of your project with a couple of configuration files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main files are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `conf.py`: it contains the configuration of the documentation and some metadata about the project, like the title, author, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `index.rst`: it is the main page of the documentation. It can be written in reStructuredText or Markdown. We prefer reStructuredText (`.rst`) as it is more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Makefile`: it contains the commands to build the documentation. You probably won't need to edit it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way for you to learn how this works is to look at examples. A simple and minimal example is provided in our `company_package` repository [here](https://github.com/borisbolliet/company_package/tree/main/docs).\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice feature is that we can add notebooks and make them part of the documentation. This is how the course website you are reading now is generated. See the [docs folder](https://github.com/borisbolliet/ResearchComputing/tree/main/docs) and in particular the [index.rst file](https://github.com/borisbolliet/ResearchComputing/blob/main/docs/index.rst) for more details on how these notebooks are linked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course website presents further optional usage, for instance setting up a specific style for exercise boxes in the file [style.css](https://github.com/borisbolliet/ResearchComputing/blob/main/docs/_static/style.css).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you understand that this is more or less limitless: you can design your documentation just like you would do for a website. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from templates that you like is probably a good idea rather than starting from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, my starting point for the template of this course website was Phillip Lippe's tutorials [here](https://github.com/phlippe/uvadlc_notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building your documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Building the documentation can be done locally, in your terminal with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd docs\n",
    "make clean\n",
    "make html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then open the generated `index.html` file in the `_build/html` folder automatically generated under `docs` in your favorite browser to view the documentation and how it lays out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Publishing your documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "To publish your documentation, we recommend using [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To set it up, you need to create an account on Read the Docs and then link your repository. It is easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to add a `.readthedocs.yml` file in the root of your repository. This hidden file\n",
    "contains the configuration for Read the Docs to know how to build your documentation. You \n",
    "can look at the [.readthedocs.yml file](https://github.com/borisbolliet/ResearchComputing/blob/main/.readthedocs.yml) of this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "The nice thing about Read the Docs is that it will automatically build your documentation on every commit in your repository. This is the first example of **continuous integration** we see in this course. To achieve this, we have setup a webhook in our github repository. You can read about how to do this [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/67240179-5394-800c-954e-9b6a85a8a1f1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: for the continuous integration part, we needed to add a `requirements.txt` file in the root of our repository. This file contains the dependencies that Read the Docs will install in a fresh environment before building your documentation, as can be understood from looking at the [.readthedocs.yml file](https://github.com/borisbolliet/ResearchComputing/blob/main/.readthedocs.yml), which contains the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# Optional but recommended, declare the Python requirements required\n",
    "# to build your documentation\n",
    "# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/reproducible-builds.html\n",
    "python:\n",
    "  install:\n",
    "  - requirements: docs/requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:** Set-up automatic documentation for a simple package of your choice and publish it on Read the Docs using continuous integration. Of course, once you are done you can always delete it if you don't want it to be public!\n",
    "</div>\n",
